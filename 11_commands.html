<b>Common commands and best practice</b>
<i>
Warning: always use caution with potentially disruptive commands like rm, mv, etc...
<br>
In Linux once a file or directory is gone, is gone. Forever. There is no possibility of recover or restore of lost files and contents, a good system administrators checks before applying any change, and absolute paths are preferred instead of relative.
<br>
Absolute paths begin with / while relative paths begin with ./ or simpli with the file or directory name without prefix. 
</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Echo</b>
<br>
The echo command works like a function that produces an output consisting of the arguments given, multiple arguments are accepted.
<br>
Echo provides options like -e (enable interpretation of backslash escapes) to let us write single lines.
<br>
The default input of echo is stdin (the arguments we type after the echo command).
<br>
The default output is stdout (the display if no redirection is set).
<br>
echo "hello" "hi"
<br>
hello hi
<br>
<br>
We can redirect the output of echo to a file, the output can be redirected to one single file only per command since the stdout can not be splitted.
<br>
echo -e "line1\nline2\nline3\nline4\nline5" > text.txt
<br>
echo -e "line6\nline7\nline8\nline9\nline10" > text2.txt
<br>
<br>
<b>Cat</b>
<br>
The command cat executes concatenation of text, it's versatile and useful to merge contents together, this means that cat accepts multiple arguments.
<br>
Cat concatenates files and print on the standard output - With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input (try typing cat and enter, stdin is displayed on stdout, ctrl+c to exit).
<br>
cat text.txt text2.txt 
<br>
line1
<br>
line2
<br>
line3
<br>
line4
<br>
line5
<br>
line6
<br>
line7
<br>
line8
<br>
line9
<br>
line10
<br>
<br>
Other options are available for cat, like line numbers display.
<br>
cat -n text.txt text2.txt 
<br>
     1	line1
<br>
     2	line2
<br>
     3	line3
<br>
     4	line4
<br>
     5	line5
<br>
     6	line6
<br>
     7	line7
<br>
     8	line8
<br>
     9	line9
<br>
    10	line10
<br>
<br>
<b>More</b>
<br>
More is a command that displays the content of the files given as argument.
<br>
The contents of the files are shown one screen at a time for large files.
<br>
If the contents of the file fit a single screen, the output will be somewhat similar to the cat command output.
<br>
more text.txt text2.txt 
<br>
::::::::::::::
<br>
text.txt
<br>
::::::::::::::
<br>
line1
<br>
line2
<br>
line3
<br>
line4
<br>
line5
<br>
<br>
<b>Less</b>
<br>
The less command is similar to the more command, it's named from the phrase "less is more", but provides extensive features.
<br>
Less allows backward and forward movement in the file, can be used after pipes, one argument is accepted.
<br>
cat text.txt text2.txt | less
<br>
line1
<br>
line2
<br>
line3
<br>
line4
<br>
line5
<br>
line6
<br>
line7
<br>
line8
<br>
line9
<br>
line10
<br>
<br>
Less provides several options, as line numbers display.
<br>
less -N text.txt
<br>
      1 line1
<br>
      2 line2
<br>
      3 line3
<br>
      4 line4
<br>
      5 line5
<br>
<br>
<b>Grep</b>
<br>
The grep command searches for lines matching a given pattern list, within given files, multiple files are accepted.
<br>
Grep searches for strings in text files and displays the matching lines found.
<br>
grep line1 text.txt 
<br>
line1
<br>
<br>
Grep provides options that let us exclude matching patterns (-v), if more files are given their names will be displayed before the matching content found in the file.
<br>
Although the pattern is accepted without quotes, it is strongly suggested to use always double quotes for the string that will be matched by grep.
<br>
Grep is widely ussed in scripts because of its versatility, speed, and precision. See #grep --help
<br>
grep -v "line1\|line2" text.txt text2.txt 
<br>
text.txt:line3
<br>
text.txt:line4
<br>
text.txt:line5
<br>
text2.txt:line6
<br>
text2.txt:line7
<br>
text2.txt:line8
<br>
text2.txt:line9
<br>
<br>
<b>Find</b>
<br>
The find command is aimed to search for files in a directory hierarchy.
<br>
It can find files and directories and perform operations on them (with -exec).
<br>
Find can search files and folders by name, creation date, modification date, owner, permissions.
<br>
Syntax # find [location] [optional expression] [-options] [optional what to find]
<br>
See #find --help
<br>
find .
<br>
# will display all the contents in the current directory without exclusion
<br>
<br>
find . -type f
# displays all the files
<br>
<br>
find . -type d
# displays all the directory
<br>
<br>
find . -type f -name "text*"
./text.txt
./text2.txt
<br>
<br>
find . -type f -iname "Text*"
./text.txt
./text2.txt
<br>
<br>
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "*.txt"
<br>
./ls_current_dir.txt
<br>
./text.txt
<br>
./text2.txt
<br>
<br>
We can not cover all the commands provided by Linux and BASH, the reader is invited to feel free to explore and search for commands, using TAB to autocomplete. 
<br>
<br>
eg. digit host and press TAB twice to see all the commands that begin with that pattern 
<br>
host [PRESS TAB TWICE]
<br>
host         hostid       hostname     hostnamectl
<br>
<br>
A good system administrator looks for commands usage checking man and the option --help
<br>
<br>
Be curious, it's the best way to learn Linux quickly and in depth.
<br>
<br>
Some useful commands to explore the features of BASH:
<br>
pwd # try also # echo $HOME
<br>
env # try also # env | grep -i home
<br>
echo # try Epoch time format # echo "$(date +%s.%N)"
<br>
printf # provides useful functions eg. limit to two decimal digits # printf "%.2f" $(date +%s.%N)
<br>
ls
<br>
cd
<br>
mkdir
<br>
cp
<br>
mv
<br>
head
<br>
tail
<br>
tr
<br>
cut
<br>
diff
<br>
date
<br>
cal
<br>
wc
<br>
ip
<br>
ps
<br>
ss # or netstat (from net-tools on RPM)
<br>
dig # (from bind-utils on RPM)
<br>
free
<br>
df
<br>
du
<br>
chmod
<br>
chown
<br>
curl
<br>
wget
<br>
top (press h for help , press q to quit)
<br>
time # try # time free -h # time 
<br>
<br>
<b>VI</b>
<br>
vi # or vim that stands for vi-improved (press ESC and type :q! to quit vi/vim without saving)
<br>
Vim is widely used to edit scripts and text files on Linux
<br>
Vim let us perform text editing quikly because our hands stay on the keyboard without moving to the mouse.
<br>
Vim includes commands that work as macros, to perform text editing with speed and precision.
<br>
Vim represents one of the most used text editor in the Linux command line, it must be mastered to become Linux experts.
<br>
Luckily the shell builtin command "vimtutor" provides a ... vim tutorial to learn it quickly!
<br>
<br>
Basic Vim Commands and Description
<br>i --- insert mode
<br>Esc --- command mode
<br>x (or DEL) --- delete a character
<br>X --- delete a character in backspace mode
<br>u --- undo changes
<br>CTRL + r --- redo changes
<br>yy --- copy (yank) current line
<br>dd --- delete current line
<br>p --- paste the clipboard/buffer content (if the last action is copy line, the line will be pasted)
<br>/ --- followed by a string search for the string, use n and N to cycle matches
<br>[[ --- or gg move to the beginning of the current file
<br>]] --- or G move to the end of the current file
<br>:%s/old_string/new_string/gci --- search old_string and replace it with new_string for all matching occurences, require confirm
<br>ESC + :w --- save file
<br>ESC + :wq or ESC + ZZ --- save file and quit Vim
<br>ESC + :wq! or ESC + :x --- force save and quit Vim
<br>ESC + :q! force --- quit Vim discarding all changes
