<h3>Linux Files System - FHS</h3>
The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS): a reference describing the conventions used for the layout of a UNIX system became popular by its use in Linux distributions, but it is used by other *nix operating systems. It is maintained by the Linux Foundation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Directory structure</h4>
In the FHS, all files and directories appear under the root directory /  even if they are stored on different physical or virtual devices.
<br>
<br>
Some of these directories only exist on a particular system if certain subsystems, such as the X Window System, are installed.
<br>
Most of these directories exist in all Unix-like operating systems and are generally used in much the same way.
<br>
However, the descriptions here are those used specifically for the FHS and are not considered authoritative for platforms other than Linux.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Directory - Description</h4>
<br>
/    Primary hierarchy directory of the entire file system hierarchy, often called "root" directory.
<br><br>
/bin    Essential command binaries that need to be available in single-user mode, including to bring up the system or repair it, for all users (e.g., cat, ls, cp).
<br><br>
/boot    Boot loader files (e.g., kernels, initrd).
<br><br>
/dev    Device files (e.g., /dev/null, /dev/disk0, /dev/sda1, /dev/tty, /dev/random).
<br><br>
/etc    Host-specific system-wide configuration files.
<br><br>
/home    Users' home directories, containing saved files, personal settings, etc.
<br><br>
/lib    Libraries essential for the binaries in /bin and /sbin.
<br><br>
/lib&lt;qual&gt;    Alternate format essential libraries. These are typically used on systems that support more than one executable code format, such as systems supporting 32-bit and 64-bit versions of an instruction set. Such directories are optional, but if they exist,they have some requirements.
<br><br>
/media    Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs (appeared in FHS-2.3 in 2004).
<br><br>
/mnt    Temporarily mounted filesystems.
<br><br>
/opt    Add-on application software packages.
<br><br>
/proc    Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files.In Linux, corresponds to a procfs mount. Generally, automatically generated by the system.
<br><br>
/root    Home directory for the root user.
<br><br>
/run    Run-time variable data: Information about the running system since last boot, e.g., currently logged-in users and running daemons. Files under this directory must be either removed or truncated at the beginning of the boot process, but this is not necessary on systems that provide this directory as a temporary filesystem (tmpfs).
<br><br>
/sbin    Essential system binaries (e.g., fsck, init, route).
<br><br>
/srv    Site-specific data served by this system, such as data and scripts for web servers, FTP servers, and repositories for version control systems (appeared in FHS-2.3 in 2004).
<br><br>
/sys    Contains information about devices, drivers, and some kernel features.
<br><br>
/tmp    Directory for temporary files (see also /var/tmp). Often not preserved between system reboots and may be severely size-restricted.
<br><br>
/usr    Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of (multi-)user utilities and applications, should be shareable and read-only.
<br><br>
/usr/bin    Non-essential command binaries (not needed in single-user mode); for all users.
<br><br>
/usr/include    Standard include files.
<br><br>
/usr/lib    Libraries for the binaries in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.
<br><br>
/usr/libexec    Binaries run by other programs that are not intended to be executed directly by users or shell scripts (optional).
<br><br>
/usr/lib&lt;qual&gt;    Alternative-format libraries (e.g., /usr/lib32 for 32-bit libraries on a 64-bit machine (optional)).
<br><br>
/usr/local    Tertiary hierarchy for local data, specific to this host. Typically has further subdirectories (e.g., bin, lib, share).
<br><br>
/usr/sbin    Non-essential system binaries (e.g., daemons for various network services).
<br><br>
/usr/share    Architecture-independent (shared) data.
<br><br>
/usr/src    Source code (e.g., the kernel source code with its header files).
<br><br>
/usr/X11R6    X Window System, Version 11, Release 6 (up to FHS-2.3, optional).
<br><br>
/var    Variable files: files whose content is expected to continually change during normal operation of the system, such as logs, spool files, and temporary e-mail files.
<br><br>
/var/cache    Application cache data. Such data are locally generated as a result of time-consuming I/O or calculation. The application must be able to regenerate or restore the data. The cached files can be deleted without loss of data.
<br><br>
/var/lib    State information. Persistent data modified by programs as they run (e.g., databases, packaging system metadata, etc.).
<br><br>
/var/lock    Lock files. Files keeping track of resources currently in use.
<br><br>
/var/log    Log files. Various logs.
<br><br>
/var/mail    Mailbox files. In some distributions, these files may be located in the deprecated /var/spool/mail.
<br><br>
/var/opt    Variable data from add-on packages that are stored in /opt.
<br><br>
/var/run    Run-time variable data. This directory contains system information data describing the system since it was booted.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In FHS 3.0, /var/run is replaced by /run; a system should either continue to provide a /var/run directory
<br>
or provide a symbolic link from /var/run to /run for backwards compatibility.
<br><br>
/var/spool    Spool for tasks waiting to be processed (e.g., print queues and outgoing mail queue).    
<br><br>
/var/spool/mail    Deprecated location for users' mailboxes.
<br><br>
/var/tmp    Temporary files to be preserved between reboots.
