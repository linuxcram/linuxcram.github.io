Computer and communication systems standards

Computer and communication systems require standards and protocols to be efficiently and effectively communicate with one another.
Standards ensure compatibility and common frameworks for development.
Standards, protocols, and other specifications aim to be universal to make programming and telecommunications easy, predictable, compatible.
Linux follows standards that are common to all computer operating systems (like TCP/IP and IEEE 802.11), and aldo standards specific to
Unix, POSIX, and Linux systems.
Linux systems are categorized as *nix (Unix-like) and mostly POSIX-compliant, since Linux follows most POSIX and Unix standards.

Linux Standard Base (LSB)
The Linux Standard Base (LSB) is an ISO standard for GNU/Linux-Linux whose purpose is to keep all Linux distros standardized
and compatible with each other.
An ISO standard is a standard set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), not all ISO standards pertain to computers.
LSB includes several other standards such as POSIX and it is adopted among most Linux distros, but not Unix systems.
Some of the adopted specifications (like POSIX) are used among Unix and Unix-like systems.
The LSB:
- sets standard of Linux systems including run levels, file system hierarchy, and many other subsystems
- supports seven architectures IA32, IA64, PPC32, PPC64, S390, S390X, x86-64
- requires support for large files
The LSB includes many "stand-alone" standards as:
- Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
- IEC 60559/IEEE 754 Floating Point
- Floating-point computation standard
- ISO C
- ISO/IEC TR14652 Character format specification
- Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)
- RFC 791 Internet Protocols
- RFC 1321 The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm
...and more

Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)
http://www.unix.org/version4/ieee_std.html
http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/
The Portable Operating System Interface, or POSIX defines a standard operating system interface and shell environment.
POSIX is defined by the IEEE Computer Society and is the core of the Single UNIX Specification (SUS).
The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for
maintaining compatibility between operating systems. POSIX defines both the system- and user-level application programming
interfaces (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for software compatibility (portability)
with variants of Unix and other operating systems. POSIX is also a trademark of the IEEE.[1] POSIX is intended
to be used by both application and system developers. 

GNU Coding Standards
The GNU Coding Standards (http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/) is a specification that provides recommendations and rules
for programming software that will execute in the GNU userland or environment. 

### The term "Linux" is used to commonly refer to the kernel and free/open source software found in distributions that contain the GNU components.
The operating system marketplace often uses one-word names such as DOS, Windows, macOS, Solaris, Irix,
and AIX, so this popular format is also used in these pages.

Note: who prefers to use the term "GNU/Linux" could mentally swap words while reading.


Client/Server Definition

The client/server model is based on the system design of an architecture that divides processing between clients and
servers that can run on the same computer or on different computers on the same network.
It is a major element of modern operating system and network design.

A server is a a program, or a computer on which that program runs, that provides a specific kind of service to clients.
A major feature of servers is that they can provide their services to more clients simultaneously.

The client is usually a program that performs requests to the server that maintains the data and processes the requests.

The client/server model has some important advantages of efficiency that have made it become the dominant type of network architecture.
This model allows many users at dispersed locations to share resources, such as a web site, a database, files or other resources.

An example is a web server, that stores the contents of web sites and serves them across the Internet to clients (web browsers) upon users requests.
By far the most popular web server is Apache, a free program which is claimed to host more than 68 percent of all web sites on the Internet.

According to W3Techs’ data about web servers Nginx holds about 34% of the market and Apache about 31%,
Microsoft-IIS holds 6%.
Apache web server and Nginx are availble for free on Linux systems.


CLI and GUI
>CLI = Command Line Interface

>GUI = Graphical User Interface

The web server systems on Linux are managed and configured using the CLI, while the web contents are usually viewed with
web browsers on systems with a GUI.
The Linux CLI provides tools to send requests to web servers, this feature is specially useful for troubleshooting purposes.
