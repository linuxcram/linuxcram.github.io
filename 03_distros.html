<b>Unix - *nix - GNU/Linux - Linux</b>
<br>
UNIX is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, whose development started in 1969 at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.
<br>
Various free, low-cost, and unrestricted substitutes for UNIX emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, including 4.4BSD, Linux, and Minix.
<br>
Some of these have in turn been the basis for commercial "Unix-like" systems, such as BSD/OS and macOS.
<br>
A Unix-like (sometimes referred to as UN*X or *nix) operating system is one that behaves in a manner similar to a Unix system, although not necessarily conforming to or being certified to any version of the Single UNIX Specification. 
<br>
Linux is an open-source Unix-like operating system based on the Linux kernel, typically packaged as a Linux distribution/distro.
<br>
Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project.
<br>
Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the importance of GNU software.
<br>
Popular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora Linux, and Ubuntu, which in itself has many different distributions and modifications, including Lubuntu and Xubuntu. Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise.
<br>
Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland, and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma.
<br>
Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether, or include a server solution stack.
Many Linux distros are freely redistributable and anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.

<b>Redhat / RHEL</b>
<br>
RHEL Red Hat Enterprise Linux is one of the main enterprise Linux platforms, certified clouds environments and with thousands of hardware and software vendors.
<br>
RHEL requires the purchase of subscriptions to benefit of all its features.

<b>Debian</b>
<br>
https://www.debian.org/
<br>
Debian is a complete free Linux-based operating system for a wide range of devices including laptops, desktops and servers.
<br>
Most hardware is supported by the Linux kernel which means that Debian will support it as well, proprietary drivers for hardware are available if necessary.
<br>
Debian is made of free and open source software, free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute, free of cost and easy to be kept up-to-date.
<br>
<br>
Why so many people choose to spend lots of hours of their own time writing software, carefully packaging and maintaining it, just to give it all away without charging for it? 
<br>
- some people simply like to help others, and contributing to a free software project is a great way to accomplish this;
<br>
- many developers write programs to learn more about computers, different architectures, and programming languages;
<br>
- some developers contribute to say "thank you" for all the great free software they've received from others;
<br>
- many people in academia create free software to share the results of their research.
<br>
Companies also help maintaining free software: to influence how applications develop or to implement new features quickly;
<br>
Most Debian developers participate, because they think it's great fun!
<br>
Debian lets users install non-free software, there is a growing number of packages which install non-free software on a Debian system.

<b>Ubuntu</b>
<br>
Ubuntu is an ancient African word meaning ‘humanity to others’. It is often described as reminding us that ‘I am what I am because of who we all are’ Ubuntu is aimed to bring this philosophy to the world of computers and software.
<br>
Ubuntu was the first operating system to commit to scheduled releases on a predictable cadence, every six months, starting in October 2004. Since 2006 every fourth release, every two years, Ubuntu would receive long-term support for large-scale deployments. This is the origin of the term LTS for stable, maintained releases.
<br>
The commercial and community teams collaborate to produce a single, high-quality release, which receives ongoing maintenance for a defined period. Both the release and ongoing updates for core packages are freely available to all users.
<br>
Commercial users engage with Canonical to gain access to support, consulting, management tools, managed services and extended security maintenance.
