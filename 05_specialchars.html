<h4>Special Characters</4>
<br>

<br>
<br>
There are many symbols and characters that the shell interprets in special ways.
<br>
<br>
Certain characters:
<br>
- cannot be used in some cases;
<br>
- may be used to perform special operations;
<br>
- must be "escaped" to be interpreted as standard characters.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Character Description</h4>
<h5>
\ Escape character.  Special characters require to be "escaped" with a backslash to be referenced. Eg. # touch test\* # will create a file named test* 
<br>/ Directory separator, used to separate a string of directory names.Example: /usr/src/linux
<br>. Current directory.  Can also "hide" files when it is the first character in a filename
<br>.. Parent directory
<br>&tilde; User's home directory
<br>* Represents 0 or more characters in a filename, or by itself, all files in a directory, eg. file*2022 can represent file2022, file01-2022, logfile_01_01_2022
<br>? Represents a single character in a filename, eg. file?.txt can represent file1.txt, filez.txt, but not file22.txt
<br>[ ] Can be used to represent a range of values, e.g. [0-9], [A-Z], etc. Example: file[0-2].txt represents the names file0.txt, file1.txt, and file2.txt
<br>| "Pipe".  Redirect the output of one command into another command, eg. # ls | more 
<br>&gt; Redirect output of a command into a new file, if the file already exists, over-write it, eg. # ls &gt; files_list.txt 
<br>&gt;&gt; Redirect the output of a command onto the end of an existing file, eg. # echo "Italy Rome" &gt;&gt; cities.txt 
<br>&lt; Redirect a file as input to a program, eg. # more &lt; files_list.txt 
<br>; Command separator.  Allows you to execute multiple commands on a single line, eg. # cd /var/log ; less messages
<br>&amp;&amp; Command separator as above, but only runs the second command if the first one finished without errors, eg # cd /var/logs && less messages 
<br>&amp; Execute a command in the background, and immediately get your shell back, eg. find / -name "*.rpm" > /tmp/rpm_files_list.txt &amp;
<br>" " Whitespace - a tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return, or space, Bash uses whitespace to determine where words begin and end, a default separator
<br>$ Expansion - parameter expansion (e.g. $var or ${var}), command substitution (e.g. $(command)), or arithmetic expansion (e.g. $((expression)))
<br>'' Single quotes - protect the text inside them so that it has a literal meaning, special characters are passed over and multiple words are prevented from being split
<br>"" Double quotes - protect the text inside them from being split into multiple words or arguments, allow substitutions to occur, usually avoid interpretation of other special characters
<br># Comment - at the begin of a line begins a comment that extends to the end of that line, comments are notes used to make scripts understandable and maintanable, comments are not processed as commands
<br>= Assignment - assign a value to a variable (e.g. logdir=/var/log/myprog), whitespace is not allowed on either side of the = character
<br>[[ ]] Test - an evaluation of a conditional expression to determine whether it is "true" or "false", tests are used in Bash to compare strings, check the existence of a file, etc
<br>! Negate - used to negate or reverse a test or exit status, eg. # ! grep text file; exit $?
<br>{ } Inline group - commands inside the curly braces are treated as if they were one command, it's convenient to use these when Bash syntax requires only one command without using a function
<br>( ) Subshell group - similar to the above but where commands within are executed in a subshell (a new process). Used much like a sandbox, if a command causes side effects (like changing variables), no effect on the current shell
<br>(( )) Arithmetic expression - with an arithmetic expression, characters such as +, -, *, and / are mathematic operators. They can be used for variable assignments like (( a = 1 + 4 )) as well as tests like if (( a < b ))
<br>$(( )) Arithmetic expansion - the expression is replaced with the result of arithmetic evaluation, eg. echo "Average: $(( (a+b)/2 ))"
<br>
</h5>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Deprecated special characters</h4>
Command substitution - it is suggested to use $( ) instead.
<br>[ ] Test - old test command alias, commonly used in POSIX shell scripts, lacks many features of [[ ]].
<br>$[ ] Arithmetic expression - it is suggested to use $(( )) instead. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Deprecated</h4>
The term "deprecated" means that something is available or allowed but it is not recommended because its limits, security issues, unwanted behaviors, failings are recognized.
<br>
Some commands are still used daily worldwide, although their adoption is discouraged because of deprecation.
<br>
Some deprecated commands and their successors/alternatives found on the newest versions of popular Linux distros are:
<br>
nslookup - dig
<br>
netstat - ss
<br>
ifconfig - ip a
<br>
route - ip r
<br>
arp - ip n
<br>
<br>
In RPM distros the deprecated commands are found thanks to the command yum provides PACKAGENAME, eg.
<br>
- netstat arp ifconfig route are provided by the package net-tools
<br>
- nslookup is provided by the package bind-utils
