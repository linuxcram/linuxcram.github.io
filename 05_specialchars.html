<br>
<b>Special Characters</b>
<br>
There are many symbols and characters that the shell interprets in special ways.
<br>
Certain typed characters
<br>
- cannot be used in certain situations
<br>
- may be used to perform special operations
<br>
- must be “escaped” if you want to use them in a normal way.
<br>
<br>
<b>Character Description</b>
<br>\ Escape character.  If you want to reference a special character, you must “escape” it with a backslash first.
<br>Example: touch /tmp/filename\* 
<br>/ Directory separator, used to separate a string of directory names.Example: /usr/src/linux
<br>. Current directory.  Can also “hide” files when it is the first character in a filename.
<br>.. Parent directory
<br>&tilde; User's home directory
<br>* Represents 0 or more characters in a filename, or by itself, all files in a directory. Example: pic*2002 can represent the files pic2002, picJanuary2002, picFeb292002, etc.
<br>? Represents a single character in a filename. Example: hello?.txt can represent hello1.txt, helloz.txt, but not hello22.txt 
<br>[ ] Can be used to represent a range of values, e.g. [0-9], [A-Z], etc. Example: hello[0-2].txt represents the names hello0.txt, hello1.txt, and hello2.txt 
<br>| “Pipe”.  Redirect the output of one command into another command. Example: ls | more 
<br>&gt; Redirect output of a command into a new file.  If the file already exists, over-write it. Example: ls &gt; myfiles.txt 
<br>&gt;&gt; Redirect the output of a command onto the end of an existing file. Example: echo “Mary 555-1234” &gt;&gt; phonenumbers.txt 
<br>&lt; Redirect a file as input to a program. Example: more &lt; phonenumbers.txt 
<br>; Command separator.  Allows you to execute multiple commands on a single line. Example: cd /var/log ; less messages
<br>&amp;&amp; Command separator as above, but only runs the second command if the first one finished without errors. Example: cd /var/logs && less messages 
<br>&amp; Execute a command in the background, and immediately get your shell back.
Example: find / -name core > /tmp/corefiles.txt &
<br>" " Whitespace - a tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return, or space. 
Bash uses whitespace to determine where words begin and end, a default separator.
<br>$ Expansion - parameter expansion (e.g. $var or ${var}), command substitution (e.g. $(command)),
or arithmetic expansion (e.g. $((expression))).
<br>'' Single quotes - protect the text inside them so that it has a literal meaning.
Special characters are passed over and multiple words are prevented from being split.
<br>"" Double quotes - protect the text inside them from being split into multiple words or arguments, 
allow substitutions to occur, usually avoid interpretation of other special characters.
<br># Comment - at the begin of a line begins a comment that extends to the end of that line. 
Comments are notes used to make scripts understandable and maintanable, comments are not processed as commands.
<br>= Assignment - assign a value to a variable (e.g. logdir=/var/log/myprog). 
Whitespace is not allowed on either side of the = character.
<br>[[ ]] Test - an evaluation of a conditional expression to determine whether it is "true" or "false". 
Tests are used in Bash to compare strings, check the existence of a file, etc.
<br>! Negate - used to negate or reverse a test or exit status. For example: ! grep text file; exit $?.
<br>{ } Inline group - commands inside the curly braces are treated as if they were one command.
It is convenient to use these when Bash syntax requires only one command without using a function.
<br>( ) Subshell group - similar to the above but where commands within are executed in a subshell (a new process). Used much like a sandbox, if a command causes side effects (like changing variables), no effect on the current shell.
<br>(( )) Arithmetic expression - with an arithmetic expression, characters such as +, -, *, and / are mathematic operators. They can be used for variable assignments like (( a = 1 + 4 )) as well as tests like if (( a < b )).
<br>$(( )) Arithmetic expansion - the expression is replaced with the result of arithmetic evaluation.
Example: echo "The average is $(( (a+b)/2 ))".
<br>
<br>

Deprecated special characters:
Command substitution - it is suggested to use $( ) instead.
<br>[ ] Test - old test command alias, commonly used in POSIX shell scripts, lacks many features of [[ ]].
<br>$[ ] Arithmetic expression - it is suggested to use $(( )) instead. 
<br>
<br>
<b>"Deprecated" meaning</b>
<br>
The term deprecated means that something is available or allowed but it is not recommended because its limits, security issues, unwanted behaviors, failings are recognized.
<br>
Some commands are still used daily worldwide, although their adoption is discouraged because of deprecation.
<br>
Some deprecated commands and their successors/alternatives found on the newest versions of popular Linux distros are:
<br>
nslookup - dig
<br>
netstat - ss
<br>
ifconfig - ip a
<br>
route - ip r
<br>
arp - ip n
<br>
<br>
In RPM distros the deprecated commands are found thanks to the command yum provides PACKAGENAME, eg.
<br>
- netstat arp ifconfig route are provided by the package net-tools
<br>
- nslookup is provided by the package bind-utils
