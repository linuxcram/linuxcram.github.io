<h4>This is not a tutorial</h4>
<br>
It's recommended to refer always to the official documentation of systems before doing any task.
<br>
<br>
The following list of commands and istructions is provided "as is" without any kind of warranty.
<br>
Do not use any of them if unsure to avoid damage and breaking systems!

<h4>AlmaLinux 9.1</h4>
<i>Post-install examples of common tasks for academic purpose</i>
<br>
hostname: linuxbox
<br>
user: root
<br>
If a student user has not been created during the installation, or if the user lacks sudo privileges, some steps may be required.
<pre>
# Disable firewalld service
systemctl disable firewalld

# Edit /etc/selinux/config
#change
SELINUX=enforcing
#with
SELINUX=disabled

# add student user if not existing
useradd -m -s /bin/bash student

# set password for student
passwd student
# enter password and repeat it to confirmm

# provide sudo privileges to the user if not already assigned
# create (with vi) a file (eg. sudo) to grant sudo privileges to student user
vi /etc/sudoers.d/sudo
student	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL

# Check that all the network interfaces are active
ip a
# same as
ip address

# take note of the IP to get connected from the host, usually begins with 192.168
# for NAT networks the standard name of the connection is enp0s8
# for BRIDGED networks the standard name of the connection is enp0s3

# Enable sshd service
systemctl enable sshd

# reboot

# Pakage manager - DNF
# yum was deprecated and replaced by dnf with Fedora22, RHEL8, CentOS8 (Almalinux9.1 uses dnf too)

# Perform an initial update of all packages
sudo dnf update -y
# or call dnf using the yum legacy command (same as using dnf)
sudo yum update -y

# Check that the package manager works
sudo dnf search vim

# Install required packages for bash scripting tutorials and exercise
sudo dnf install -y vim wget


# COMMAND to turn off the vm #
sudo shutdown -h now
</pre>

<pre>
# Disable cloud-init (avoid its related messages)
sudo touch /etc/cloud/cloud-init.disabled

# Disable firewalld service
sudo systemctl disable ufw

# Disable apparmor service
sudo systemctl disable apparmor

# sudo reboot

# Pakage manager - APT
# apt provides fewer options than apt-get and it's aimed by Debian to be "pleasant for end users" for pakages management

# Perform an initial update of all packages
sudo apt update -y
# or with apt-get
sudo apt-get update -y

# Check that the package manager works
sudo apt search vim

# Set vim as default text editor
sudo update-alternatives --config editor
# enter the number (default is 3) corresponding to /usr/bin/vim.basic

<h3>### SSH CONNECTION TO THE VM ###</h3>
<i>SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that provides access to remote computers in a secure way.</i>
<br>
<br>
Guest Virtual Machine example data 
<br>
hostname: linuxbox
<br>
user: student
<br>
IP: 192.168.56.5
<br>
<br>
<h4>--- SSH connection from Linux host ---</h4>
<pre>
- Open terminal
- Type
  ssh student@192.168.56.5
- when requested, type the password for student

# The prompt will change to
[student@linuxbox &tilde;]$
</pre>
<br>
<br>
<h4>--- SSH connection from Windows host ---</h4>
<b><i>
An SSH Client software is suggested, a popular free SSH client is <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">PUTTY</a>.
<br>
Available for Windows 64bit as msi package, the first entry after #MSI ('Windows Installer') 64-bit x86 #
</i></b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Example for SSH connection with Putty:</b>
<pre>
- Open the SSH client software (Putty)
- Type the IP address 192.168.56.5 in the field "Host name or IP address" and clic "Open"
- at the Login type student
- when requested, type the password for student

# The prompt will be similar to
[student@linuxbox &tilde;]$
