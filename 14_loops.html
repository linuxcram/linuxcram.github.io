<h3>Common loops in programming languages</h3>
The loop constructs are common programming building blocks that allow us to repeat the execution of a section of code through an iteration.
<br>
<br>
The three main types of iteration constructs in bash are the count-controlled loops (or definite iteration), the condition-controlled loops (or indefinite iteration), the infinite loops.
<br>
<br>
The count-controlled loop repeats the execution of a section of code for a certain number of times. The counting can be upward or downward with varying step size. This loop generally uses a for loop construct.
<br>
<br>
The condition-controlled loop repeats the execution of a section of code until a condition is met. The condition may be tested at the beginning, or the end of the loop. This loop generally uses a while loop construct.
<br>
<br>
The infinite loop repeats the execution of a section of code forever or until an exception arises. This loop often uses a while true loop construct and is sometimes called an endless loop or a forever loop.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>BASH LOOPS</h3>
<h4>For Loop</h4>
for i in {1..3}; do echo $i; done
<br>
# or
<br>
for i in 1 2 3; do echo $i; done
<br>
<br>
i is an arbitrary name of the variable which will be assigned the values defined in the specified range
{1..3} or 1 2 3 represents the range of value that will be assigned to i by the "for" cycle, the echo command will use the value assigned to i as argument for each cycle of the for loop
<br>
<br>
<b>Count-controlled For Loop (counter)</b>
<br>
for ((x=0 ; x&lt;5 ; x++)); do echo $x; done
<br>
<br>
x is an arbitrary name of the variable that the for cycle will use to assign the values in the range
the range is represented numerically starting from 0, using the incremental function x++ that will increase its value by 1 unit
<br>
<br>
x&lt;5 represents the limit condition that will interrupt the for cycle, until this condition is true the incremental function will be applied, and echo will get the value of x as argument, when the condition x=5 is reached the cycle is terminated
<br>
<br>
<h4>While Loop</h4>
x=1; while (( x &lt;= 5 )); do echo $((x++)); done
<br>
<br>
x is the arbitrary name of the variable
the incremental funtion will be applied until the condition is reached, that means that x is incremented by 1 unit while its value satisfy the condition x &lt;= 5, and its value is printed on screen by echo, when the limit value is reached with x=6 the cycle is terminated
<br>
<br>
<h4>Until Loop</h4>
x=3; until (( x &lt;= 0 )); do echo $((x--)); done
<br>
#same of
<br>
x=3; until (( x <= 0 )); do echo $(( --x )); done
<br>
<br>
x is the arbitrary name of the variable that will have an initial value of 3 and that will be decremented of 1 unit until x&lt;=0, echo receives every value of x as argument, once x reaches the value of -1 the cycle is terminated
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Warning</b>
<br>
Bad scripts may contain endless loops resulting in infinite operations!
<br>
Hopefully they could be terminated with ctrl+c 
<br>
Endless loops examples - commented out because not meant to be never used!
<br>
# for (( ; ; )); do echo "infinite loop"; done
<br>
# while : ; do echo "infinite loop"; done
<br>
# while true : ; do echo "infinite loop"; done
<br>
# until false; do echo "infinite loop"; done
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Conditional Statements</h3>
<br>
<h4>If</h4>
The if statement is a conditional expression, that evaluates the result of the command based on the exit status.
<br>
<br>
If the command completes successfully, the condition is true and the exit status is 0
<br>
<br>
If the statement produces an error, the condition is false and the exit status is any number between 1 and 255
<br>
<br>
<b>If syntax</b>
<br>
The single bracket represent a test command following the standard POSIX utility available for all shells.
<br>
if [ CONDITION ]
<br>
then
<br>
  COMMANDS
<br>
fi
<br>
<br>
The double-bracket syntax in bash scripts is the best option if portability is not necessary,
<br>
double-brackets are superior to single-brackets and include adcanced options.
<br>
if [[ CONDITION ]]
<br>
then
<br>
  COMMANDS
<br>
fi
<br>
<br>
The if else statement includes the definition of different actions based on the output of the condition. 
<br>
if [ CONDITION ]
<br>
then
<br>
  COMMANDS
<br>
else
<br>
  COMMANDS
<br>
fi
<br>
<br>
The elif clause combined with the if else statement performs multiple conditional checks with different results.
<br>
if [ CONDITION ]
<br>
then
<br>
  COMMANDS
<br>
elif [ CONDITION ]
<br>
then
<br>
  COMMANDS
<br>
else
<br>
  COMMANDS
<br>
fi
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nested if statements perform a first if check of a condition that if satisfied passes to a the next check.
<br>
if [ CONDITION ]
<br>
then
<br>
    if [ CONDITION ]
<br>
    then
<br>
        COMMANDS
<br>
    fi
<br>
fi
<br>
<br>
<h4>Case</h4>
The bash case statement can simplify complex conditionals when we have multiple different choices.
<br>
The case statement can be used to replace nested if statements to produce bash scripts more readable and easier to maintain.
<br>
<br>
Syntax:
<br>
case EXPRESSION in
<br>
  PATTERN1)
<br>
    statement
<br>
    ;;
<br>
  PATTERN2)
<br>
    statement
<br>
    ;;
<br>
  PATTERN3)
<br>
    statement
<br>
    ;;
<br>
  *)
<br>
    statement
<br>
    ;;
<br>
esac
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><i>Case example</i></h4>
script checkday.sh
<br>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
# define current weekday
day=$(date +"%a")
# case statement to check if today is a weekday or a weekend day and print the corresponding result
case $day in 
  Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri)
    echo "Today is a weekday";;
  Sat | Sun) 
    echo "Today is weekend";;
  *)
    echo "Error: current day is not defined";;
esac
</pre>
<br>
# set executable permissions for the current user
<br>
chmod u+x checkday.sh
<br>
<br>
# run the script, note that when a script is run it is required the prefix ./ to declare its location, if the script is not located in "bin" directories that the system uses for binaries (such as /usr/local/bin , /usr/bin , etc)
<br>
./checkday.sh 
<br>
<br>
# the output of the script, run on a weekday, is:
<br>
Today is a weekday
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>About if conditions and operators</h4>
The following conditions will return a true value if the corresponding element type exists:
<pre>
-f    common regular file
-d    directory
-e    any type of file
-r    readable file
-w    writable file
-x    executable file
-s    file exists and its size is not zero
-L    symbolic link
</pre>
<br>
Often the best practice is to define the first condition that, if false, would cause failure of next tasks.
<br>
<br>
If the unmet condition compromises the main task, the script often may exit with a custom exit code and a messsage.
The usage of exit codes add efficiency to scripts (0 for "no errors" , other custom values for "errors").
<br>
<br>
This way, if a required condition for the script is not met, less commands will be executed, saving time and resources.
<br>
<br>
The ! negation is useful to check if a condition is unmet.
<br>
<br>
Examples
<pre>
# if element met the condition, execute the operation
if [ -e test.txt ]
then
  cat test.txt
fi

# if element met multiple conditions (double brackets required by bash), execute the operation
if [[ -e test.txt && -r test.txt && -s test.txt ]]
then
  cat test.txt
fi

# if element met at least one of the conditions, execute the operation
if [[ -e test.txt || -e testfile_20.txt || -e test_abc.txt ]]
then
  ls -lh test*
fi

# if element does not met the condition, exit, otherwise (condition met) execute the operation
if ! [ -e test.txt ]
then
  echo "Error: missing file"
  exit 11
else
  cat test.txt
  exit 0
fi

# if element does not met the condition, exit, otherwise (condition met) execute the operation
if ! [ 1 -lt 2 ]
then
  echo "Error: 1 is not &lt; 2"
  exit 11
else
  echo "OK 1 is &lt; 2"
  exit 0
fi
</pre>
