<h3>Brief tale about a Bash script</h3>
<br>
<h4>I - BIRTH # url_checker.sh</h4>
Once upon a time there was a Sysadmin that used a bash one-liner to display the first line matching the word &lt;title&gt; in a the html code of the URL debian.org:
<br>
curl -kLs debian.org | grep -e "&lt;title&gt;" | head -1
<br>
<pre>
The command output was:
  &lt;title&gt;Debian -- The Universal Operating System &lt;/title&gt;
</pre>
<br>
Since the users kept asking the command syntax distracting the Sysadmin from other activities,
<br>
the Sysadmin put the command inside a script to simplify the commands execution, making it available for all users:
<pre>
url_checker.sh
#!/bin/bash
curl -kLs debian.org | grep -e "&lt;title&gt;" | head -1

chmod +x url_checker.sh

Execution went fine and users could run the script:
./url_checker.sh 
  &lt;title&gt;Debian -- The Universal Operating System &lt;/title&gt;
</pre>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>II - FIRST CHANGE # url_checker2.sh </h4>
Later on, an user wanted to remove the html tags from the output, add wanted the URL printed first.
<br>
<br>
So the user decided to update the script, luckily leaving the original file untouched, making a copy named url_checker.sh.
<br>
mv url_checker.sh url_checker2.sh.
<br>
<br>
The user found on the Internet website "slackoverslow" the echo command that would print text on display, so the user decided to copy and paste the command to the script, simply changing the text between quotes.
<br>
echo “Hello”
<br>
<pre>
The new version was:
url_checker2.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo “debian.org”
curl -kLs debian.org | grep -e "&lt;title&gt;" | head -1 | sed 's/&lt;title&gt;//g' | sed 's/&lt;\/title&gt;//g'

The output was ...so and so... wait, didn't they said that echo prints what it's inside quotes, excluded the quotes?
./url_checker2.sh 
“debian.org”
  Debian -- The Universal Operating System 
</pre>
<br>
<br>
<i>In fact code copied and pasted from the Internet could contain dirty or unexpected chars, spot the differences:</i>
<br>
echo “debian.org”
<br>
echo "debian.org"
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>
Lesson learned : DETAILS ARE IMPORTANT!
<br>
General rule: DO NOT BLINDLY RUN SHELL COMMANDS OR SCRIPTS FOUND ON THE INTERNET!
</h4>
No matter how trusted is the source, we must always read and understand before run anything.
<br>
The Linux shell is so powerful that a wrong command can cause data damage and permanently break systems.
<br>
<pre>
After that the wrong quotes chars was spotted and corrected, the new version become:
url_checker2.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "debian.org"
curl -kLs debian.org | grep -e "&lt;title&gt;" | head -1 | sed 's/&lt;title&gt;//g' | sed 's/&lt;\/title&gt;//g'


Execution was ok:
./url_checker2.sh 
debian.org
  Debian -- The Universal Operating System
</pre>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>III - MORE URLS # url_checker3.sh</h4>
The Sysadmin was required to update the script to check a list of URLs listed in a text file
<br>
<pre>
cat url_checker_list.txt 
almalinux.com
centos.org
debian.org
ubuntu.com
</pre>
<br>
Furthermore the Sysadmin had to update the script to make it compliant to the new standards model defined by the organization.
<br>
<br>
The script should provide a single string for every URL checked, include variables, error/variables checks, comments, exit codes.
<pre>
The new version was:
url_checker3.sh
#!/bin/bash
# exit on error or undefined variable
set -o errexit
set -o nounset
#
# Variables
urls_list="url_checker_list.txt"
#
# Conditional cycle to exit on missing input file, or perform operations reading URLs from list file
if ! [ -s $urls_list ]
then
  echo -e "Error: pages list file not found or file is empty."
  exit 11
else
  for url in $(cat url_checker_list.txt | tr '\n' ' ')
  do
    curl_result=$(curl -kLs "$url" | grep -e "&lt;title&gt;" | head -1 | sed 's/&lt;title&gt;//g' | sed 's/&lt;\/title&gt;//g')
    echo -e "$url $curl_result"
  done
  exit 0
fi



...for curiosity try to change the order of the three last lines and see what happens this way:
  exit 0
  done
fi
</pre>
<br>
....after that restore the correct order o keep it working!
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>IV - NEW STANDARD MODEL # url_checker4.sh </h4>
The Sysadmin found that the new standard model of scripts expected the use of functions, so the script should be updated to comply, this became an occasion to make order and cleanliness.
<br>
<pre>
The new version was:
url_checker4.sh
#!/bin/bash
# exit on error or undefined variable
set -o errexit
set -o nounset
#
# Variables
urls_list="url_checker_list.txt"
#
# Function that prints URL and first line of html code without tags, reading URLs from list file url_checker_list.txt
pages_list_check(){
  for url in $(cat url_checker_list.txt | tr '\n' ' ')
  do
    curl_result=$(curl -kLs "$url" | grep -e "&lt;title&gt;" | head -1 | sed 's/&lt;title&gt;//g' | sed 's/&lt;\/title&gt;//g')
    echo -e "$url $curl_result"
  done
}
# Conditional cycle to exit on missing input file url_checker_list.txt or perform operations
if ! [ -s $urls_list ]
then
  echo -e "Error: pages list file not found or file is empty."
  exit 11
else
  pages_list_check
  exit 0
fi
</pre>
<br>
<br>
<h4>V - MORE URLS, SAME SCRIPT!</h4>
<br>
The URLs check department found that they required the title of more sites, so Sysadmin was required to add the new URLs to the check.
<br>
He updated the list file adding the URLs without touching the script and checked that the file was as expected since double checks are important.
<pre>
echo -e "redhat.com\nlinuxmint.com\nopenbsd.org\nalpinelinux.org" >> url_checker_list.txt

cat url_checker_list.txt
almalinux.com
centos.org
ubuntu.com
debian.org
redhat.com
linuxmint.com
openbsd.org
alpinelinux.org


The script worked smoothly:
./url_checker4.sh 
almalinux.com     AlmaLinux OS - Forever-Free Enterprise-Grade Operating System
centos.org     The CentOS Project
ubuntu.com   Enterprise Open Source and Linux | Ubuntu
debian.org   Debian -- The Universal Operating System 
redhat.com     Red Hat - We make open source technologies for the enterprise
linuxmint.com 	Home - Linux Mint
openbsd.org 	OpenBSD
alpinelinux.org         index | Alpine Linux
</pre>
<br>

...And they all lived happily ever after.
