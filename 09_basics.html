<b<>BASH Scripting basics</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Shebang</b>
<br>
The shebang is the character sequence #! at the beginning of a script, aka sharp-exclamation, sha-bang, hashbang, pound-bang, hash-pling.
<br>
syntax #!interpreter [optional-arg]
<br>
<br>
The shebang is required to be placed in the first line of a bash script, it's meant to specify the interpreter to be used for the script.
In Linux we will find and use the shebang that execute the file using the Bash shell intepreter 
<br>
#!/bin/bash
<br>
<br>
#!/usr/bin/env bash  is an alternative shebang that finds and use the bash executable path from the user environment variable, in this case it is the same of #!/bin/bash but on some systems it may be different
<br>
[student@linux ~]$ env | grep SHELL
SHELL=/bin/bash
<br>
<br>
No extension is required for Bash Script File when you specify Hash Bang #!/bin/bash as the first line of code, but it's best practice to provide the extension to script files so that they are easily recognizaable.
<br>
eg. script.sh  script.bash
<br>
There is no functional difference between these extension because the interpreter is defined by the shebang in the first line of each script that will be   #!/bin/bash
<br>
<br>
<b>Assign executable permission to the script<b/>
<br>
Linux recognize the file types reading their header's code, relying on the file content
<br>
Applications can detect and use specific files extensions (.list, .repo, .gz, .tar), humans too use extensions to recognize the file types with ease.
<br>
It's common use to name text files .txt , scripts .sh or .bash , logfiles .log and so on.
<br>
Script files require executable permissions to be run, the command to obtain this is chmod.
<br>
eg.
<br>
chmod u+x script.sh  script.bash
<br>
chmod 755 script.sh
<br>
chmod 775 script.bash
<br>
<br>
Notes about Linux permissions
<br>
Linux adopts the octal permission system to set permissions of files and directories, based on binary values from 000 (---) to 777 (rwx):
<br>
Octal permissions are defined in 3 blocks:
<br>
- the user that is owner of the file/directory
<br>
- the group that is owner of the file/directory
<br>
- all other users
<br>
<br>
A file with 777 permissions will let all users read, write and execute it, 
to check the permissions of files and directories, we can use ls -l of the desired path, to display the long listing format of the contents, including the owner and the group of the owner:
<br>
[student@linux ~]$ ls -l
<br>
-rw-rw-r--. 1 student student 28445 Dec  6 10:29 centos
<br>
-rwxrw-r--. 1 student student    99 Dec 12 12:58 script.sh
<br>
<br>
The three octets are:
<br>
User(owner) - UserGroup(owner) - Other users
<br>
rwx         - rwx              - rwx
<br>
<br>
Octal permissions representation in binary, base10 and text:
<br>
binary  base10  text
111     7       rwx
110     6       rw-
101     5       r-x
100     4       r--
011     3       -rx
010     2       -w-
001     1       --x
000     0       ---
<br>
<br>
A file to be executable must have permissions "x" for the user or group that will require to run it.
If I am planning to run a file with my user, it's enough to apply the relative permission
chmod u+x since my user is owner of this file.
<br>
-rwxrw-r--. 1 student student    99 Dec 12 12:58 script.sh
<br>
The absolute command for the same permissions is chmod 764 script.sh
<br>
<br>
If other users must be enabled to run the script, chmod o+x will be used to set executable permissions to all users
<br>
-rwxrw-r-x. 1 student student    99 Dec 12 12:58 script.sh
<br>
The absolute command for the same permissions is chmod 765 script.sh
<br>
<br>
If the chmod command is used to add permissions with + operator, without specifying u,g or o the permission is assigned to all three octets (User,Group,Owner)
<br>
chmod +x checkyearif.sh
<br>
-rwxrwxr-x. 1 student student   222 Dec 12 15:43 checkyearif.sh
<br>
<br>
The inverted behavior is obtaine using the - sign, that removes permissions, if present for the contents
<br>
chmod -x checkyearif.sh
<br>
-rw-rw-r--. 1 student student   222 Dec 12 15:43 checkyearif.sh
<br>
<br>
The same permissions of a file can be applied to another using the specific option provided by chmod
<br>
chmod --reference=checkyearcase.sh checkyearif.sh
<br>
This will assign the same permissions of the reference file to the destination file
