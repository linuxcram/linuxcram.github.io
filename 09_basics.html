<h3>BASH Scripting basics</h3>
<h4>Shebang</h4>
The shebang is the character sequence #! at the beginning of a script, aka sharp-exclamation, sha-bang, hashbang, pound-bang, hash-pling.
<br>
<br>
syntax #!interpreter [optional-arg]
<br>
<br>
The shebang is required to be placed in the first line of a bash script, it's meant to specify the interpreter to be used for the script.
<br>
In Linux we will find and use the shebang that execute the file using the Bash shell intepreter.
<br>
#!/bin/bash
<br>
<br>
#!/usr/bin/env bash  is an alternative shebang that finds and use the bash executable path from the user environment variable,
<br>
in this case it is the same of #!/bin/bash but on some systems it may be different
<br>
<br>
[student@linux ~]$ env | grep SHELL
<br>
SHELL=/bin/bash
<br>
<br>
<br>
No extension is required for Bash Script File when you specify Hash Bang #!/bin/bash as the first line of code,
<br>
but it's best practice to provide the extension to script files so that they are easily recognizaable.
<br>
The extension to choose usually depends on the standard in use on a system/environment/framework.
<br>
# script.sh
<br>
# script.bash
<br>
<br>
There is no functional difference between these extension because the interpreter is defined by the shebang
<br>
in the first line of each script that will be the same #!/bin/bash
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Assign executable permission to the script</h4>
Linux recognize the file types reading their header's code, relying on the file content
<br>
<br>
Applications can detect and use specific files extensions (.list, .repo, .gz, .tar), humans too use extensions to recognize the file types with ease.
<br>
<br>
It's common use to name text files .txt , scripts .sh or .bash , logfiles .log and so on.
<br>
<br>
Script files require executable permissions to be run and the command to obtain this feature is called chmod.
<br>
<br>
chmod u+x script.sh  script.bash
<br>
chmod 755 script.sh
<br>
chmod 775 script.bash
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Notes about Linux permissions</h4>
Linux adopts the octal permission system to set permissions of files and directories, based on binary values from 000 (---) to 777 (rwx):
<br>
<br>
Octal permissions are defined in 3 blocks:
<br>
- the <b>user</b> that is owner of the file/directory
<br>
- the <b>group</b> that is owner of the file/directory
<br>
- all <b>other</b> users
<br>
<br>
<br>
A file with 777 permissions will let all users read, write and execute it.
<br>
To check the permissions of files and directories, we can use ls -l (option to use a long listing format, see man ls) of the desired path,
<br>
the owner and the group of the owner will be shown together with permissions, type, size, modification/creation date and time:
<br>
[student@linux ~]$ ls -l
<br>
-rw-rw-r--. 1 student student 28445 Dec  6 10:29 test.txt
<br>
-rwxrw-r--. 1 student student    99 Dec 12 12:58 script.sh
<br>
<br>
The three octets that compose the permissions set are:
<pre>
User - UserGroup - Other users
rwx  -    rwx    -    rwx
</pre>
<br>
Octal permissions representation in base2 (binary), base10 (decimal) and text:
<pre>
base-2  base-10  text
111     7       rwx
110     6       rw-
101     5       r-x
100     4       r--
011     3       -rx
010     2       -w-
001     1       --x
000     0       ---
</pre>
<br>
To be executable a file must have permissions "x" for the user or group that run it.
<br>
If it's planned to run a file with the current user, it's enough to apply the relative permission since the user is owner of the file.
<br>
<br>
chmod u+x script.sh
<br>
-rwxrw-r--. 1 student student    99 Dec 12 12:58 script.sh
<br>
<br>
The absolute command option for the same permissions is chmod 764 script.sh
<br>
<br>
If other users must be enabled to run the script, chmod o+x could be used to set executable permissions to all users.
<br>
chmod u+x script.sh
<br>
-rwxrw-r-x. 1 student student    99 Dec 12 12:58 script.sh
<br>
<br>
The absolute command option for the same permissions is chmod 765 script.sh
<br>
<br>
If the chmod command is used to add permissions with + operator, without specifying u,g or o the permission is assigned to all three octets (User,Group,Owner).
<br>
<br>
chmod +x script.sh
<br>
-rwxrwxr-x. 1 student student   222 Dec 12 15:43 script.sh
<br>
<br>
The inverted behavior is obtained using the - sign, that removes permissions, if present for the contents, otherwise they will remain unchanged.
<br>
<br>
chmod -x script.sh
<br>
-rw-rw-r--. 1 student student   222 Dec 12 15:43 script.sh
<br>
<br>
The same permissions of a file can be applied to another using the specific option provided by chmod.
<br>
<br>
chmod --reference=checkyearcase.sh script.sh
<br>
This command will assign the same permissions of the reference file to the destination file.
