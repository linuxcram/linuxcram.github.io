<h3>Bash scripting best practice</h3>
<br>
Linux system administrators best practice includes the automation of tasks.
<br>
Automation represents a solution to be more effective and efficient, that transforms the time to manage repetitive, frustrating, and error prone activities, into time to focus on improvements, upgrades and evolution.
<br>
A well implemented automation multiply the effort result.
<br>
<br>
When scripting, sometimes can be necessary to execute single specific commands due to limitations caused by arguments and options that don't fit with wildcards or loop cycles.
<br>
<br>
<b>Comments</b>
<br>
Comments make scripts better and understandable.
<br>
The use of Comments is one of the most important best practice for Bash scripting, as well for other programming languages.
<br>
Comments provide a precious help for us and others to understand which kind of operations are performed within our scripts.
<br>
<br>
<i>Try to imagine a script 1000 lines long without comments, wouldn't it be more intelligible with comments?</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Comments are defined using the # character</b>
<br>
# This is a comment that will not produce any output in a script
<br>
# This line is a comment, it's simply ignored by the Bash command interpreter
<br>
<br>
<b>Exit on specific conditions</b>
<br>
Exit on script failures
<br>
set -o errexit
<br>
# or
<br>
set -e
<br>
<br>
<b>Exit on undeclared variable detected</b>
<br>
set - o nounset
<br>
# or
<br>
set -u
<br>
<br>
<h3>Variables</h3>
Variable names can contain ONLY alphanumeric chars (a-z, A-Z ,0-9) and underscore ( _ ).
The variable names can begin with an alphabet char or underscore, since numbers are not allowed as first char.
Variables can not be named using reserved words of statements, loops, functions (if, then, else, for, do, done...).
Avoid to name custom variables with command names, system VARIABLES and words recognized by the operating system (like ls cd, vi, hostname, ping, ip, pwd, free, USER, SHELL, HOME...).
<br>
Use Uppercase Names for ENVIRONMENT Variables and lowercase for custom variables, since all variables defined in the bash enviromnent are named with uppercase letters.
<br>
The best practice suggested is to use lowercase letters to name the custom variables in order to avoid variable name conflicts. 
<br>
<br>
<pre>
# variable names OK
today
date_now
ip_loopback
random_number1
Logfile
output_log
_string1

# variable names not OK
TODAY
1date_now
ip
1RANDOMNUMBER
/home/Logfile
$log%
HOSTNAME
</pre>
<br>
<b>Use Double Quotes to Reference Variables</b>
<br>
Using double quotes helps to prevent word splitting if there are whitespaces, and unnecessary globbing, providing wildcars recognizing and expanding.
<br>
<br>
eg. script distros.sh
<br>
<br>
#!/bin/bash
<br>
# exit on command fail
<br>
set -o errexit 
<br>
# exit on use of unset variable
<br>
set -o nounset
<br>
echo "Distros names without double quotes:" 
<br>
names="Redhat CentOS Debian Ubuntu"
<br>
for name in $names; do
<br>
echo $name
<br>
done
<br>
echo "Distros names with double quotes:" 
<br>
for name in "$names"; do
<br>
echo "$name"
<br>
done
<br>
exit 0
<br>
<br>
[student@linux ~]$ chmod u+x distros.sh
<br>
[student@linux ~]$ ./distros.sh
<br>
<br>
# outuput
<br>
Distros names without double quotes:
<br>
Redhat
<br>
CentOS
<br>
Debian
<br>
Ubuntu
<br>
Distros names with double quotes:
<br>
Redhat CentOS Debian Ubuntu
<br>
<br>
<b>Functions</b>
<br>
The longer the script, the more functions will help us to make it more readable and reusable.
<br>
This rule helps system administrators to maintain scripts updated, efficient, and to avoid writing list of commands from scratch every time.
<br>
<br>
Unless the script is very short, the best practice consists in grouping commands within functions.
<br>
Examples of syntax to use functions:
<br>
<br>
function check_value(){
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command1;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command2;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command3;
<br>
}
<br>
<br>
# or
<br>
check_value(){
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command1;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command2;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command3;
<br>
}
<br>
<br>
<b>Functions can be used also in one liners:</b>
<br>
check_value(){ command1; command2; }
<br>
<br>
<b>Examples</b>
<br>
The command date displays on screen the current date in the standard Linux format
<br>
date 
<br>
Mon Dec 12 11:34:15 AM CET 2022
<br>
<br>
We want to get the current date, to extract only the YEAR field, then compare it with values, and finally display a text based on the result.
<br>
We can use several commands combined together in "pipelines", commands separated by | where the output of a command is sent as input to the next command.
<br>
<br>
# extract the year value from the current date
<br>
<br>
# using cut command in many flavors
<br>
date | cut -c 28-31
<br>
2022
<br>
<br>
date | cut -d " " -f7
<br>
2022
<br>
<br>
date |  cut -d ' ' -f 7-
<br>
2022
<br>
# using awk
<br>
date | awk '{print $7}'
<br>
2022
<br>
<br>
date | awk '{print $NF}'
<br>
2022
<br>
<br>
# using grep
<br>
date | grep -o '[^ ]*$'
<br>
2022
<br>
<br>
# let's combine bash + perl
<br>
date | perl -nE'say $1 if /(\S+)$/'
<br>
2022
<br>
<br>
# perl - one block of lines to copy and paste
cat << EOF > test.pl
<br>
#!/usr/bin/perl
<br>
use POSIX qw(strftime);
<br>
\$year = strftime "%Y", localtime;
<br>
printf("%02d\n", \$year);
<br>
EOF
<br>
chmod u+x test.pl; \
<br>
perl test.pl; \
<br>
rm test.pl;
<br>
<br>
# python3 (default on RHEL9 / AlmaLinux9)
python3 -c "import datetime; \
<br>
d1 = datetime.datetime.now(); \
<br>
print(d1.year);";
<br>
2022
<br>
# or
<br>
python3 -c "import datetime; \
<br>
d1 = datetime.datetime.now(); \
<br>
print(d1.strftime('%Y'));";
<br>
2022
<br>

<i>As we see, if we know 99 ways to do something with Bash, it's possible that there is a 100th way, maybe faster, cleaner and understandable, to obtain the desired result.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Let's get back to the mentioned example goal, we want to extract only the YEAR field from the current date, compare it with values and display a text based on the result.
<br>
<br>
We can use several commands, let's assume we use date and cut to get the year from the current date:
date | cut -d " " -f7
<br>
2022
<br>
<br>
eg. one-liner that compares the previous command result using the if statement in a function
<br>
<br>
check_year(){ if [[ $(date | cut -d " " -f7) = "2022" ]]; then echo "Year is 2022"; else echo "Year is not 2022"; fi; };check_year
<br>
Year is 2022
<br>
<br>
Despite one-liner are widely used, they are sometimes tricky to use, moreover scripts provide a clearer view.
<br>
eg. if statement - script checkyearif.sh
<br>
#!/bin/bash
<br>
# exit on command fail
<br>
set -e
<br>
# exit on use of unset variable
<br>
set -u
<br>
check_year(){
<br>
  if [[ $(date | cut -d " " -f7) = "2022" ]]
<br>
    then echo "Year is 2022"
<br>
  else
<br>
    echo "Year is not 2022"
<br>
  fi
}
<br>
check_year
<br>
<br>
chmod u+x checkyearif.sh
<br>
./checkyearif.sh 
<br>
Year is 2022
<br>
<br>
eg. case statement in one-liner
<br>
datenow=$(date | cut -d " " -f7); check_year(){ case $datenow in 2022)  echo "Year is 2022";; 2023) echo "Year is 2023";; esac;}; check_year;
<br>
<br>
eg. case statement in a Bash script - checkyearcase.sh
<br>
#!/bin/bash
<br>
# exit on command fail
<br>
set -e
<br>
# exit on use of unset variable
<br>
set -u
<br>
datenow=$(date | cut -d " " -f7)
<br>
check_year(){
<br>
  case $datenow in 2022)  echo "Year is 2022";;
<br>
  2023) echo "Year is 2023";;
<br>
  esac
<br>
}
<br>
check_year
<br>
<br>
chmod u+x checkyearcase.sh
<br>
./checkyearcase.sh 
<br>
Year is 2022
<br>
<br>
<b>Use = instead of == for String Comparisons</b>
<br>
Note that == is a synonym for = it's preferred the use of a single = for string comparisons.
<br>
<br>
eg. script checkdistro.sh
<br>
#!/bin/bash
<br>
# exit on command fail
<br>
set -e
<br>
# exit on use of unset variable
<br>
set -u
<br>
distro1="ubuntu"
<br>
distro2="debian"
<br>
if [ "$distro1" = "$distro2" ]
<br>
then
<br>
echo "$distro1" is equal to "$distro2"
<br>
else
<br>
echo "$distro1" is not equal to "$distro2"
<br>
fi
<br>
<br>
chmod u+x checkdistro.sh
<br>
./checkdistro.sh 
<br>
ubuntu is not equal to debian
<br>
<br>
<b>Use $(command) instead of legacy backquotes/grave accents/backticks in `command` substitution.</b>
<br>
Command substitution replaces a command with its output, it's recommended to use $(command) that nests properly, unlike backquotes `command`.
<br>
<br>
# avoid # user=`echo “$UID”`; echo $user
<br>
# adopt # user=$(echo “$UID”); echo $user
<br>
<br>
# avoid # echo "`date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S"`"
<br>
# adopt # echo $(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
<br>
<br>
<b>Use read-only to declare static variables</b>
<br>
A static variable keeps its value unaltered altered once defined in a script.
<br>
<br>
readonly passwd_file=”/etc/passwd”
<br>
readonly group_file=”/etc/group”
<br>
<br>
<b>Declare files and paths as variables to make clearer scripts and simplify their maintenance</b>
<br>
<br>
eg. script info.sh
<br>
#!/bin/bash
<br>
set -o errexit 
<br>
set -o nounset
<br>
# define logfile named with the timestamp
<br>
logfile="./info_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).log"
<br>
# write information in the logfile, sequentially appending the command outputs in the given order
<br>
echo -e "host:" $(hostname) >> $logfile
<br>
echo -e "user:" $(whoami) >> $logfile
<br>
echo -e "date:" $(date) >> $logfile
<br>
<br>
chmod u+x info.sh
<br>
./info.sh 
<br>
<br>
cat info_2022-12-13_15-00-54.log 
<br>
host: linux
<br>
user: student
<br>
date: Tue Dec 13 03:00:54 PM CET 2022
<br>
<br>
<h3>Let's put together some of these rules in practice</h3>
eg. script logdate.sh
<br>
#!/bin/bash
<br>
# exit on command fail
<br>
set -e
<br>
# exit on use of unset variable
<br>
set -u
<br>
# Use lowercase to define custom variables and use uppercase for environment variables
<br>
test_logfile="$HOME/test_$(date +"%Y%m%d").log"
<br>
# check if the logfile exists
<br>
if ! [ -f "$test_logfile" ]
<br>
# If the file of today does not exist, it is created and the output of the commands is appended to it
<br>
# A message is displayed to confirm that the task is completed without errors
<br>
then
<br>
  echo "---" >> $test_logfile
<br>
  date >> $test_logfile
<br>
  echo "---" >> $test_logfile
<br>
  echo "Today's logfile has been created and successfully written."
<br>
  exit 0
<br>
# If the file already exists, display a message and exit with error code 1, without performing any further action
<br>
else
<br>
  echo "Today's logfile already exists. Exiting."
<br>
  exit 1
<br>
fi
<br>
<br>
chmod u+x logdate.sh
<br>
./logdate.sh 
<br>
First run result:
<br>
./logdate.sh ; echo $?
<br>
Today's logfile has been created and successfully written.
<br>
